# LinkedIn-Adjusted-R-Squared

R Square GIF Code:
Code for generating adjusted R-squared for different predictor combinations and plotting them using mtcars dataset
The R code uses the mtcars dataset inbuilt in R to generate linear models for various predictor combinations.
I have plotted the adjusted-R-suqared vs the iteration and animated it into a GIF.

Rsquare GIF:
Here, in R I have created 100 random x-values.
I have generated y-values based on a simple linear relationship: y=2+3x
I have added random noise with rnorm()
I have created a loop of 1 to 5 to store the value of R-square with each added degree of polynomial.
