# LinkedIn-Adjusted-R-Squared
Code for generating adjusted R-squared for different predictor combinations and plotting them using mtcars dataset
The R code uses the mtcars dataset inbuilt in R to generate linear models for various predictor combinations.
I have plotted the adjusted-R-suqared vs the iteration and animated it into a GIF.
